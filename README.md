# NBA_Shotrt_Player_Tableau_Dashboard

As a fan of basketball and the Toronto Raptors. Watching Fred VanVleet as a rookie till current times (2022), he is an exceptional player but also very short compared to majority of NBA players. This led to the quest about shorter players and 3P (Three Points) compared to taller players.

The tableau story illustrates the change is 3PA (Three Points Attempted) over a decade (1999-2020) and then compares how short players compete statistically in 3P and in other fields to determine even if shorter players are more proficient in shooting 3P, does it make up for their lack of other key fields, such as AST (assists), REB (rebounds), PTS (points) etc.
